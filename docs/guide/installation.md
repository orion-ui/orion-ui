# Installation

The recommanded way is pretty common, via the **Command Line Interface**.

The recommanded way is to use the package manager **NPM** so that you can use **Orion** with a bundler like Vite or Webpack for example.

``` sh:no-line-numbers
# Go in your project root folder
cd my-project

# If it's not an npm project yet
npm init

# Then install Orion
npm install --save @orion.ui/orion
```

That's it ! **Orion** is now part of your dependencies and can be used in your project.
