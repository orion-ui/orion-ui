# OrionIcon

`<o-icon>` displays an icon from the library [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) with the prop `icon`, or from your own icon font with the prop `font-icon`.

You can easily customize it with some props to add ripple effect on click, a visual marker to alert about notifications or  a button style.

:::info
It is possible to set the default icon style in the Orion configuration, which is `outlined` by default.
([more informations here](../guide/quick-start.md))
:::

:::tip
The cursor style will automatically switch to `pointer` if a `click` listener is applied on `<o-icon>`.
